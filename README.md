Supermarket Check Out
 
Supermarket checkout is implemented that calculates the total price of a number of items.
 
Some items have multiple prices based on price rules such as:
- buy 3 (equals) items and pay for 2
- buy 2 (equals) items for a special price
- buy 3 (in a set of items) and the cheapest is free
- for each N (equals) items X, you get K items Y for free
 
The output is the receipt with the actual price of every item and the grand total.
